# NaiveBayes_Implementation
This project is to implement NaiveBayes algorithm with smoothing technique. 

Build a Naive Bayes classifier for the given training data with add 1 smoothing technique: <br />

Instance, Education Level, Career, Years of Experience, Salary <br />
1,High School,Management,Less than 3,Low <br />
2 ,High School,Management,3 to 10,Low <br />
3,College,Management,Less than 3,High <br />
4,College,Service,More than 10,Low <br />
5,High School,Service,3 to 10,Low <br />
6,College,Service,3 to 10,High <br />
7,College,Management,More than 10,High <br />
8,College,Service,Less than 3,Low <br />
9,High School,Management,More than 10,High <br />
10,High School,Service,More than 10,Low <br />
<br />

Use our model to classify the following new instances: <br />
Instance, Education Level, Career, Years of Experience, Salary <br />
1,High School,Service,Less than 3 <br />
2,College,Retail,Less than 3 <br />
3,Graduate,Service,3 to 10 <br />
